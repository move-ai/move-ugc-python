Takes are a way to define a recording session. A single take can be associated with a video file and optionally additional files.

> ðŸ’¡ Additional files is a planned feature which is not supported right now, the plan is to support additional file types: DEPTH, INTRINSIC, ODOMETRY, VISION, MOVE


## Prequisites

As a minimum requirement to create a take you need to have a video file. You can create a video file by following the [usage guide](/move-ugc-python/latest/getting-started/usage/file/).

## Creating a take

To create a take you need at least a video file with optional additional file types mentioned above.

### Create a take with only a RGB video file

```python
take = ugc.takes.create(video_file_id="file-457e23c2-6afc-4913-91f6-36522245d57d")
```

### Create a take with additional files (planned)

> ðŸ’¡ This is a planned feature and does not work right now.

```python
from move_ugc.schemas.additional_file import AdditionalFileIn, TakeAdditionalFileKeys
take = ugc.takes.create(
    video_file_id="file-457e23c2-6afc-4913-91f6-36522245d57d",
    additional_files=[
        AdditionalFileIn(
            key=TakeAdditionalFileKeys.depth,
            file_id="file-ee02c1b6-0328-4a7c-a2b2-76883acb451d",
        )
    ]
)
```

### Attaching some custom metadata with your take

The metadata attribute in take type accepts any valid json string and can contain any custom data. This is particularly useful if any business logic needs to be implemented such as attaching a user id to a take.

```python
import json
take = ugc.takes.create(
    video_file_id="file-457e23c2-6afc-4913-91f6-36522245d57d",
    metadata=json.dumps({"foo": "bar"}),
)
```

## Querying for a take

```python
take = ugc.takes.retrieve(id="take-2be2463e-ffa3-419b-beb4-ea0f99c79512")
```

## Fetching associated types with a take

```python
take = ugc.takes.retrieve(id="take-2be2463e-ffa3-419b-beb4-ea0f99c79512", expand=["video_file"])
```

> ðŸ’¡ Currently supported attributes for expand are `client`, `video_file` and `additional_files`
> Please note that expand feature can only be used to fetch types which are 1 level deep i.e. you cannot perform an expansion of `video_file.client`.
> To fetch a client associated with a video_file you need to perform a [separate request](/move-ugc-python/latest/getting-started/usage/file/#retrieving-an-existing-file).
